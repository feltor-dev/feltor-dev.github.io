FELTOR is a scientific code project that consists of both a numerical library
and a collection of physical simulation codes built on top of it.

Please check out our [Wiki](wiki.md)
for some general overview over the code and our design goals and
troubleshooting.

In the [Documentation](http://feltor-dev.github.io/doc/dg/html/modules.html)
you will find the technical documentation of the library.
There, we also provide pdf files
with background information on the numerical methods employed, in particular
the discontinuous Galerkin methods, which might look deterrent for beginners.

In the [Showroom](showroom.md) we present some example simulation results.

In [Publications](publications.md) we feature publications that were
achieved with the help of our libary.


## Acknowledgements

FELTOR has been developed by Matthias Wiesenberger and Markus Held since 2012, who
by that time worked at Innsbruck University, Austria.
We received funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) within
project W1227 and Y398 under project leader Alexander Kendl at
Innsbruck University.
The work has been carried out within
the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium and has received funding
from the Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018 under
grant agreement No 633053.
MW has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme under the Marie
Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 713683 (COFUNDfellowsDTU).

We gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions and code contribution from

* Ralph Kube
* Eduard Reiter
* Lukas Einkemmer
* Jakob Gath

We are grateful to

* Roman Iakymchuk,

who provided the exblas library for binary reproducible scalar products and advice
on how to use and adapt it.
We further acknowledge support on the Knights landing architecture from
the High Level Support Team from

* Albert Gutiérrez
* Xavier Saez

and from Intel Barcelona

## Terms of use
FELTOR is [fair](https://www.force11.org/fairprinciples) software and
licensed under the very permissive [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). The MIT
License grants you great freedom in what you do with the code as long as
you name us (Matthias Wiesenberger and Markus Held) as creators, in
particular in publications that use FELTOR to produce results. In this
case we suggest to take a snapshot of the used code and create and cite
a DOI via e.g. [Zenodo](http://www.zenodo.org) or to cite one of the
existing DOIs if you did not alter the contained code in any way. We are
happy if you cite our papers, but you don't have to just because you
used our code and we certainly do not demand to be coauthors when we do
not contribute directly to your results.

## Releases
Our latest code release has a shiny DOI badge from zenodo


[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1207806.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1207806)


which makes us officially citable.
