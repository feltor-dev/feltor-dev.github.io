FELTOR is [fair](https://www.force11.org/fairprinciples) software and
licensed under the very permissive [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). The MIT
License grants you great freedom in what you do with the code as long as
you name us (Matthias Wiesenberger and Markus Held) as creators, in
particular in publications that use FELTOR to produce results. In this
case we suggest to take a snapshot of the used code and create and cite
a DOI via e.g. [Zenodo](http://www.zenodo.org) or to cite one of the
existing DOIs if you did not alter the contained code in any way. We are
happy if you cite our papers, but you don't have to just because you
used our code and we certainly do not demand to be coauthors when we do
not contribute directly to your results.
